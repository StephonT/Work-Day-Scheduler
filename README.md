# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

This application uses third party API and JavaScript to create a calendar style scheduler allowing users to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS by using jQuery. Be advised, starter code was provided for this project. The starter code uses Moment.js library to work with date and time.

## Purpose

This Work Day Scheduler will allow users to plan their work day accordingly at each hour. The user will see a display of the current day and date at the top of the calendar when using the planner. The user will then be presented with time blocks for standard business hours. The time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When the user clicks on the time block, they will be able to enter in an event and save the event to the local storage. When the page is refreshed, the saved events persist. Please see the screen shot animation of this project.
